          Hello! My name is Tim Snyder. I am currently a student at Bellevue College,
          and I am pursuing a bachelorâ€™s degree in computer science. I enjoy learning
          about software development and study languages and frameworks when I am not in school.
          Outside of school, I work at a nonprofit that provides childcare to in-need families.
          Right now, I am learning a lot about React and MaterialUI that I use for web projects
          such as this site but I also am learning java and python as well. Feel free to contact
          me anytime :)
